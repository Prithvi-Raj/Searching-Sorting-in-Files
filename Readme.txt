PROJECT DETAILS

This project comprises of searching and sorting parts of large files mainly logs files and database files.
Problem Statement
Mainly while working on large files a user may face problem of searching multiple string in multiple files. And while searching in huge files the time required for execution of searching is quite high. So this project makes use various searching algorithms for searching at the same time minimizing time of execution for multiple search format.

TOOLS USED
LANGUAGE: C++
PLATFORM: LINUX

FILE TYPES AND CONTENT
All the files of same data types like .txt, .log, .docx etc. will all be opened at once. The content of all files will be shown separately and user will be notified further.

SEARCHING MULTIPLE STRINGS
User will enter collection of random strings one by one. All entered strings will now be searched from all files and will be displayed as per as file name which contains it and line number which contains it. A separate output file will also be created for future reference.

SORTING AND OUTPUT
User will be notified if whether he wants a sorted output to his searched strings or not. If he selects yes the output to search will be sorted and displayed in the program.


Internship.docx is included for more details on preject.
Any improvement on project will be much appreciated specially if UI is included.

HOW TO USE:
1. Open terminal in Linux.
2. Compile main file using //g++ main.cpp.
3. Now use ./a.out to run output file.
3. Suppose if you want to open all files with .txt extension then use command like this ./a.out *.txt
4. Further steps are sequenced in project itself.
5. sorting.cpp and search.cpp are just combination and comparison of all searching and sorting algorithms in one file.
